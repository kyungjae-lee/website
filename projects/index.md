### Side Projects

* **[STM32 MCU Custom Bootloader](stm32-mcu-custom-bootloader)**

  A custom bootloader for the STM32F407xx MCU family that  allows the host to communicate with the bootloader over the USART  interface and perform MCU‐specific operations through an interactive  application

* **[LCD Digital Clock]()**

  LCD digital clock development using the Tiny RTC Module  (DS1307) and  the 16x2 Character LCD (HD44780U) interfacing with the  STM32F407G-Discovery board

* **[MCU Peripheral Drivers]()**

  MCU peripheral (GPIO, I2C, SPI, USART) drivers development from scratch using the STM32F407G-Discovery board

* **[Bare‑Metal RTOS]()**

  Real‐time operating system development on the bare‐metal STM32F407G‐Discovery board

* **[FreeRTOS Projects]()**

  A collection of projects designed to practice the FreeRTOS kernel integration, porting, and application development for STM32  target board

* **[TCP/IP Group Chat Application]()**

  Multi‐threaded client/server socket applications for Linux OS using C and the POSIX thread libraries
