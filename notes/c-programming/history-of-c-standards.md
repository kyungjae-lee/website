# History of C Standards



## History of C Programming Language Standardization

* The C programming language was initially developed in AT&T Bell Labs by Professor Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Rithche, known as **K&R C**.
* In 1970, C programming became very popular but without any serious standardization to the language.
* The non-official standard was called K&R C, which led to many ambiguities among different compiler programmers, and that led to non-portable programs.
* K&R C was the first non-official C standard.
* In 1989 American National Standard Institute designed and approved the first official C standard called **X3.159-1989**, and in 1990 it was approved by ISO as an international standard for C programming language: I**SO/IEC 9899:1990** (This is also called **ANSI C** or **C89** or **C90** standard in short.)
* The language underwent a few more changes (addition of new features, syntaxes, data types, etc.) and newly updated standard released in 1999 under the ISO tag **ISO/IEC 9899:1999** which is also called **C99** standard in short.
* **C11** is an informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2011, which is a new standard approved in December 2011. C11 supersedes the C99 standards.
* In this notebook, we will be using the C11 standard with some compiler (GCC) extensions (gnu11).



## Compatibility

* Note that if you have written a program using C90 standard, then it will compile without any issues in `-std=c99` compilation (backward compatibility).
* If you have written a program using C99 standard specific features, then it may not compile successfully in C90 compilation.
