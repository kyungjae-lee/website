# Optimization



## Optimization

Optimization is a series of actions taken by the compiler on your program's code generation process to reduce:

* Number of instructions (code space optimization)
* Memory access time (time space optimization)
* Power consumption

By default, the compiler doesn't invoke any optimization on your program (i.e., Optimization level 0; `-O0`). Optimization can be enabled by using the compiler optimization flags.



## Optimization Levels (GCC Compiler Flags)

You need to work with different optimization levels to find out what works best for your situation.

### `-O0` 

* **No optimization (default)**

* Not recommended for productions if you have limited CODE and RAM space
* Has fastest compilation time
* Debugging friendly and used during development
* Code that works with `-O0` optimization level may not work with higher optimization levels. Code needs to be verified again when it is compiled with different optimization level.
* Note that many other compilers do substantial optimization even if "no optimization" is specified. With gcc, it is very unusual to use `-O0` for production if execution time is of any concern, since `-O0` means (almost) no optimization. This difference between gcc and other compilers should be kept in mind when doing performance comparisons.

### `-O1` 

* **Moderate optimization**

* Optimizes reasonably well (to decrease memory access time and code space) but does not degrade compilation time significantly

### `-O2` 

* **Full optimization**

* Generates highly optimized code and has the slowest compilation time
* Not debugging friendly

### `-O3`

* **Full optimization as in `-O2` + some more aggressive optimization steps taken by the compiler**

* Has slowest compilation time
* May cause bugs in the program
* Not debugging friendly

### `-Os`

* Optimizes space usage (code and data) of resulting program.



## Effect of Optimization

* No optimization (`-O0`)
