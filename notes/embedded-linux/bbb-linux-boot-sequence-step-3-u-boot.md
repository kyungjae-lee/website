## U-boot

* Initialize some of the peripherals like I2C, NAND Flash, ETHERNET, UART, USB, MMC, etc, because it supports loading kernel from all these peripherals.

* While in U-boot, the target can communicate with the host over UART, USB, etc.

* Load the Linux kernel image from various boot sources to the DDR Memory of the board.

  Boot sources could be USB, eMMC, SD card, Ethernet, serial port, NAND Flash, etc.

* Passing of boot arguments to the kernel.

* The file `uEnv.txt` need to be provided. It contains environment variables that determines the behavior of U-boot.

  * You can overwrite these environment variables to alter the behavior of the U-boot.

  * Use this file to set the environment variables which drives the U-boot according to your needs.

* U-boot always looks for **uImage**, which is nothing but **zImage + U-boot image header**.

  U-boot gets information from the U-boot image header. (Basically, the total size of the structure `image_header` is 64 bytes.)

## Demonstration

* Download the root file system `Angstrom-systemd-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-beagleboard.rootfs` to be used in our demo. (Inside the `boot/` folder, `uImage-3.8.10` is the kernel image we will be using.)

* Copy all the folders in side the root file system into the ROOTFS section of your SD card.

  ```plain
  .../Angstrom-systemd-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-beagleboard.rootfs
  $ sudo cp -r * /media/klee/ROOTFS/
  ```

  And, sync:

  ```plain
  $ sync
  ```

* Now, you need to tell U-boot where to locate the Linux kernel image using `uEnv.txt`. Copy this file into BOOT section. It is in under `boot/` folder. (It does not come filled out of the box. You need to fill it in.)

  ```plain
  console=ttyUSB0,115200n8
  ipaddr=192.168.7.2
  serverip=192.168.7.1
  loadaddr=0x82000000
  fdtaddr=0x88000000
  loadfromsd=load mmc 0:2 ${loadaddr} /boot/uImage;load mmc 0:2 ${fdtaddr} /boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb
  linuxbootargs=setenv bootargs console=${console} root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw 
  uenvcmd=setenv autoload no; run loadfromsd; run linuxbootargs; bootm ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}
  ```

  > L4: Load address of DDR memory  (Telling the U-boot to keep the Linux kernel at this address)
  >
  > L5: `.dtb` file address
  >
  > L8: `bootm` is where U-boot hands over the control to the Linux kernel.

* Unmount the SD card from your system:

  ```plain
  umount /media/klee/BOOT
  umount /media/klee/ROOTFS
  ```

* Insert your SD card into BBB and open minicom.

* Boot from SD card, then you'll see all the boot messages followed by the login screen from Angstrom.

## Decoding U-boot Header of uImage Manually

* Reading U-boot header information of the uImage manually by using U-boot commands

  1. **Load the uImage from Memory device (SD card / eMMC) into DDR memory of the board.**

     * At power on, keep pressing "spacebar" to enter U-boot prompt. (minicom)

       > If, in your environment, the keyboard doesn't seem to work, check your minicom setting and disable Hardware Flow Control: `Ctrl + A` $\to$ `o` $\to$ `Serial port setup` $\to$ `Hardware Flow Control : No`. If Hardware flow control enabled, then minicom will not be able to send data to BBB via serial cable. Minicom will take log messages from BBB. (This took me 5 hours to figure out!)
  
     * To load a file from FAT based file system into memory, use `fatload`.
  
       To load a file from any file system: `load`
  
       Example:
  
       ```plain
       fatload usb 0:1 0x82000000 uImage
       fatload mmc 0:1 0x88000000 initramfs
       load mmc 0:1 0x88000000 uImage 
       ```
  
       > MMC0 interface $\to$ $\micro$SD card
       >
       > MMC1 interface $\to$ eMMC
  
     * Use `help` to use help functionality. e.g., `help load`
  
     * Use `load` to load uImage from the memory device into DDR memory of the board. First 64 bytes starting from 0x82000000 is the U-boot Image Header.
  
       ```plain
       ==> load mmc 0:2 0x82000000 /boot/uImage
       4002080 bytes read in 291 ms (13.1 MiB/s)
       ```
  
       > * 2 in `0:2` because our uImage is in the `boot/` folder in the 2nd partition of the SD card.
       >
       > * 0x82000000 is DDR address.
  
       This loads uImage from the memory device into DDR memory of the board. First 64 bytes starting from 0x82000000 is the U-boot Image Header.
  
  2. **Use the memory dump command of U-boot to dump header information.**
  
     * Use `md` to display memory: 
  
       ```plain
       ==> md 0x82000000 4
       82000000: 56190527 62153da1 50d07e51 e0103d00    '..V.=.bQ~.P.=..
       ```
  
       > Display 4 objects starting from the specified memory address. 
       >
       > First object is `ih_magic`, the magic number. Since this is in **little-endian**, the actual magic number is 0x27051956.
       >
       > Fourth object is `ih_size`, the image data size. Since this is in **little-endian**, the actual size is 0x3d10e0, which is 4002016 in decimal, together with 64 byte makes 4002080 that we got earlier with `load` command.
  
       And so on...
  
     * Use `imi` command to dump image information:
  
       ```plain
       => imi 0x82000000
       
       ## Checking Image at 82000000 ...
          Legacy image found
          Image Name:   Angstrom/3.8.10/beaglebone

          Data Size:    4002016 Bytes = 3.8 MiB

          Verifying Checksum ... OK
       ```

* There are many more U-boot command you can use. Consult the U-boot documentation!
