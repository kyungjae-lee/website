# Exercise - Booting U-boot Image on BBB



## Booting U-boot Image on BBB

* Copy `u-boot-beaglebone-2013.04-r0.img` into the SD card. Rename the file to `u-boot.img`.



<img src="./img/booting-up-to-u-boot-from-sd-card.png" alt="booting-up-to-u-boot-from-sd-card" width="700">



* Ends with the error message "File not found /boot/uImage" because the kernel image is not found.
* If you've reached this point, you've successfully booted up to U-boot.
