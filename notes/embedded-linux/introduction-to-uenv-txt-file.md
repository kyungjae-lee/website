# Introduction to uEnv.txt File



## The Essence of uEnv.txt File

* uEnv.txt file is nothing but a collection of various environment variables which are initialized to a number of U-boot commands that automates the command execution.



## Important Background Knowledge

* Minicom window $\to$ Boot BBB (e.g., Boot from eMMC) to U-boot prompt

### U-boot Commands

* `help` will display all the U-boot commands supported by the current version of U-boot.

  Specify the command if you need to see only a specific command: `help <command>`

  ```plain

  version - print monitor, compiler and linker version
  ```

### U-boot Environment Variables

* Similar to Linux environment variables, U-boot also has a set of standard as well as user defined environmental variables which determine the behavior of the U-boot. This behavior can be altered by overriding or changing the environmental variable values.

* Use `printenv` to display all environment variables.

  ```plain
  => printenv soc
  soc=am33xx
  ```

* Use `setenv` to set the value of a specified environment. (Creates on if the environment variable is not present.)

  ```plain
  => setenv serverip 192.168.27.1
  => printenv serverip
  serverip=192.168.27.1
  ```

* You can also combine multiple U-boot commands delimited by `;` in one envinronment variable. (They all will run in one go!)

  ```plain
  => printenv bootcmd
  bootcmd=if test ${boot_fit} -eq 1; then run update_to_fit;fi;run findfdt; run init_console; run envboot; run disd
  ```

* Use `run` to run a command.

### Exercise

* Create a user-defined environment variable.

  ```plain
  => setenv my_mmc_list 'mmc list'
  => printenv my_mmc_list 
  my_mmc_list=mmc list
  => run my_mmc_list 
  OMAP SD/MMC: 0
  OMAP SD/MMC: 1
  ```

  > `mmc list` is a predefined U-boot command.
  >
  > MMC0 is the interface to $\micro$SD card.
  >
  > MMC1 is the interface to eMMC.
