# Overview



## Introduction

This project focuses on acquiring in-depth knowledge of firmware and real-time operating systems (RTOS) used in embedded systems. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of embedded OS development, from setting up the development environment to advanced topics like multi-core synchronization and message handling. By following a structured approach, this project will provide hands-on experience and theoretical insights necessary for effective embedded system design and implementation.



## Topics to be Covered

The topics to be covered include, but not limited to:

* Development environment setting
* Compiler
* Linker
* Bootloader
* Processor
* Interrupt handling
* Memory management
* Peripheral control
* Multi-core synchronization
